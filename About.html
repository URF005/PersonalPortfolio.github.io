                My name is Usama Rehan Farooqi. I was born in Wahcantt basically I am from Azad Kashmir. I did my<b> FSC </b>Pre-Engineering from Sirsyed college campus-II. Now I'm doing software engineering <b>BS(CS)</b> from CASE Institute of Technology, Islamabad. I believe my strength is my attitude, and I like to take up challenges and think to accept both success and failure in a balanced way to move forward. I want to say that I don't leave any questions altogether as I believe in myself and my work.My short-term goal is to find a platform to expand my career and grow with the organization. And my long-term goal is to be the cause of the organization's success. Therefore, I always challenge myself to improve my progress and steady growth.
